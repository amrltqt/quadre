# quadre Docs

Welcome to the documentation for quadre (Not A Dashboard App) â€” a Python toolkit and CLI that renders dashboard PNGs from JSON using Cairo.

- What it is: a lightweight Flex layout engine, reusable UI components (text, KPI cards, tables), and a declarative JSON adapter.
- What you get: a deterministic renderer, schema validation with friendly warnings, and Docker/Make integration.
